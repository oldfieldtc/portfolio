        <p id="home__profile">
            Hey, I'm Tommy Oldfield.<br>
            I'm a web developer living in Dundee, Scotland.<br>
            I'm 30 years old and I've been making websites and web apps since 2016 (not including trying to edit my MySpace page layout as a teen).<br>
            I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create my websites and I've used the Python frameworks Django and Flask to create websites and web applications in the past. In my work as a web developer for the <a href="../work/university-of-st-andrews">University of St Andrews</a>, my focus is on PHP and WordPress.

    <h2>More info</h2>
    <p>
        I started my web development journey by completing Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course and then completing <abbr title="CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course">CS50w</abbr> straight after.<br>
        At the end of 2019, as I was finishing CS50W, I got a job as a web developer for the <a href="../work/university-of-st-andrews">University of St Andrews</a>, which is where I am working to this day.<br>
        Right now I'm using TerminalFour to update the site and working with PHP and Javascript to update various WordPress sites and their themes.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also have a few hobbies that keep me busy. I've been playing the guitar since I was 12 and have played in a few bands throughout high school and university. Through playing the guitar, I'm always listening to music, and I'm always on the lookout for new bands and artists to listen to.
        <br>
        I've spent countless hours raiding in Final Fantasy XIV, sim racing in Assetto Corsa, and not getting any better at Dota 2. I'm also an avid Formula 1 fan.
