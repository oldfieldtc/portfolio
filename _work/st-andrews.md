# University of St Andrews
I'm incredibly lucky to work at the University of St Andrews as part of the [Digital Communications team](https://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/) as a web developer where I work on updating the website using TerminalFour, answer support calls, create and update collections in FunnelBack, and work on the WordPress multisite, which includes developing and updating the University WordPress theme, and developing plugins.

## WordPress
As well as being responsible for maintaining over 800 sites on the WordPress multisite, I have helped develop the main University theme using the University's Digital Pattern Library, as well as child themes for the Events and News sites. To help with maintenance, I developed a plugin to automate auditing the multisite and generate reports.
