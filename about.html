    <p id="home__profile">
        Hey, I'm Tommy Oldfield.<br>
        I'm a web developer living in Dundee, Scotland.<br>
        I'm 28 years old and I've been making websites and web apps since 2016 (not including trying to edit my MySpace page layout as a teen).<br>
        I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python to create my websites. In my work as a web developer for the University of St Andrews, my focus is on PHP and WordPress.

<h2>More info</h2>
<p>
    I started my web development journey by completing Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course and then completing <abbr title="CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course">CS50W</abbr> straight after.<br>
    Around the end of 2019, as I was finishing CS50W, I got a job as a web developer for the University of St Andrews, which is where I am working to this day.<br>
    Right now I'm using TerminalFour to update the site and working with PHP to update various WordPress sites and their themes.
</p>
<p>
    I also have a few hobbies that keep me busy. I've been playing the guitar since I was 12 and have played in a few bands throughout high school and university. Through playing the guitar, I'm always listening to music and I'm always on the lookout for new bands and artists to listen to.
    <br>
    I've spent countless hours raiding in Final Fantasy XIV, sim racing in Assetto Corsa, and not getting any better at Dota 2. I'm also an avid Formula 1 fan.
